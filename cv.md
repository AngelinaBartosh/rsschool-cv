### About me
My name is Angelina Bartosh and I'm from Belarus. I study at the B Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics with a degree in system programmer. During the training, I studied:
* C/C++
* Java
* SQL
* Git
* HTML/CSS
* JavaScript
  
 Web development attracted me the most. In addition to lectures at the university, I began to study this area on my own, but unfortunately I did the practical part only in laboratory work.
